Anu provides in-house tailoring services, where she offers all her customers not just off the shelf designs, but also a custom fit, tailored and alterable choices.</p>
          <p>In short, she is all about trendy Indo-Western wear, and mainly focus on fit, comfort, flexibility, customization, and choice. Basically, Anuâ€™s Touch will be a one stop shop for all your fusion clothing brand with a touch of Indian essence ðŸ˜Š</p>
          <p>Apart from her passion for designing, she is a loving mother, wife and a great friend. She enjoys many aspects of art right from music, painting, cooking, interior designing and love for movies.</p>
